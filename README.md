# Task 8: Build a Functional To-Do List Application (CRUD)

## Project Description
In this task, I developed a fully functional To-Do List application using Vanilla JavaScript. The project focuses on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and managing the Document Object Model (DOM) dynamically without page reloads.

## Key Features Implemented
* **Dynamic Task Creation**: Implemented logic to capture user input and create list items using `document.createElement()` for safer DOM practices.
* **Task Validation**: Added basic validation to ensure empty tasks cannot be added to the list.
* **State Management**: Used a JavaScript array to store tasks and keep the UI in sync with the application state.
* **Interactive UI**: Added functionality to mark tasks as completed by toggling CSS classes and deleting tasks using event listeners.
* **Event Handling**: Captures input via both the "Add" button and the "Enter" key for a better user experience.

## Deliverables
* **Functional App**: A To-Do list with add, delete, and complete features.
* **Clean Manipulation**: Smooth DOM updates that do not require a page refresh.
